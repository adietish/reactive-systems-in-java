# Reactive Systems in Java book examples

Welcome World!

These are the working examples for Reactive Systems in Java from O'Reilly and written by Clement Escoffier and Ken Finnigan.

## How to open and run the examples?
Readers of the book should directly open projects from subfolders: they are all independent and self-contained.

You will find Maven build descriptors for each project, so you can load the projects with text editors or integrated development environments such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse IDE or Microsoft Visual Studio Code.

As an example if you want to build the code example from the chapter 2, open a terminal and run:

$ cd chapter-2
$ ./mvnw package

The book examples work best using some Unix environment: Linux, macOS or the Windows Subsystem for Linux from Microsoft.

## What is the structure of the repository?

The following folders are available:

* [Chapter 2 - Introduction to Quarkus](./chapter-2)
* [Chapter 3 - Distributed Systems: What the heck?](./chapter-3)
* [Chapter 4 - Design Principles of Reactive Systems](./chapter-4)
* [Chapter 5 - Reactive Programming: Taming the asynchrony ](./chapter-5)

The _master_ branch is where you must look for working examples.
